<h3>Capital</h3>
<p>Japan's capital is Tokyo</p>

<h3>Official Languages</h3>
<p>More than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language.[7] Japanese is an agglutinative language distinguished by a system of honorifics reflecting the hierarchical nature of Japanese society, with verb forms and particular vocabulary indicating the relative status of speaker and listener. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals.[262]

Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages,[263] but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.[264] Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.[265][266]</p>

<h3>Population Size</h3>
<p>Japan's population is estimated at around 128 million,[230] with 80% of the population living on Honshū. Japanese society is linguistically, ethnically and culturally homogeneous,[231][232] composed of 98.5% ethnic Japanese,[7] with small populations of foreign workers.[231] Zainichi Koreans,[233] Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent,[234] Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan.[235] In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents stationed throughout the country)[236] and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians (said to be primarily Japanese descendants, or nikkeijin, along with their spouses),[234] the largest community of Westerners.[237]

The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu[238] and Ryukyuan peoples, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin.[239] There are persons of mixed ancestry incorporated among the Yamato, such as those from Ogasawara Archipelago.[240] In 2014, foreign-born non-naturalized workers made up only 1.5% of the total population.[241] Japan is widely regarded as ethnically homogeneous, and does not compile ethnicity or race statistics for Japanese nationals; sources varies regarding such claim, with at least one analysis describing Japan as a multiethnic society[242] while another analysis put the number of Japanese nationals of recent foreign descent to be of less than 0.5% of the population.[232] Most Japanese continue to see Japan as a monocultural society. Former Japanese Prime Minister and current Finance Minister Tarō Asō described Japan as being a nation of "one race, one civilization, one language and one culture", which drew criticism from representatives of ethnic minorities such as the Ainu.[243]

Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010–2015.[22][244] The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post–World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050.[245]</p>

<h3>Land Area in Square Kilometers</h3>
<p>377,962 km²</p>

<h3>Currency</h3>
<p>Japan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP,[131] and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2016, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world.[132] In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline with the size of the country's deficit and borrowing level. The large budget deficits and government debt since the 2009 global recession and followed by the earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the rating downgrade.[133] The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.[134]

Japan has a large industrial capacity, and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, electronics, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Agricultural businesses in Japan cultivate 13 percent of Japan's land, and Japan accounts for nearly 15 percent of the global fish catch, second only to China.[7] As of 2016, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65.9 million workers.[7] Japan has a low unemployment rate of around four percent. Some 20 million people, around 17 per cent of the population, were below the poverty line in 2007.[135] Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.[136]

Japan's exports amounted to US$4,210 per capita in 2005. As of 2014, Japan's main export markets were the United States (20.2 percent), China (17.5 percent), South Korea (7.1 percent), Hong Kong (5.6 percent) and Thailand (4.5 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts.[7] Japan's main import markets as of 2015 were China (24.8 percent), the United States (10.5 percent), Australia (5.4 percent) and South Korea (4.1 percent).[7]

Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country.[137] Junichirō Koizumi's administration began some pro-competition reforms, and foreign investment in Japan has soared.[138]

Japan ranks 27th of 189 countries in the 2014 ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment.[137][139] Japanese companies are known for management methods like "The Toyota Way", and shareholder activism is rare.[140] Japan's top global brands include Toyota, Honda, Canon, Nissan, Sony, Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG), Panasonic, Uniqlo, Lexus, Subaru, Nintendo, Bridgestone, Mazda and Suzuki.[141]</p>
